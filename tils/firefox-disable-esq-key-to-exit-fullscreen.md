# Firefox | Disable Esq Key To Exit Fullscreen

## Context

How to disable `esq` key to exit fullscreen?

## Question

## Answer

```
It is way easier - in Firefox:

1. In the URL bar write "about:config"
2. Agree with security risks
3. Search for "escape", it should find the entry _browser.fullscreen.exit_on_escape_
4. Double click on "true", it should go to "false"
```
