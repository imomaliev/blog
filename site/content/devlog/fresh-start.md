I tend to be overly obsessive and pedantic when it comes to finding answers, especially when I'm looking for a "better" way to do something. I sometimes spend hours falling deeper into the rabbit hole of a perfectionist's spiral: a quick web search for one question can lead to dozens of open tabs. I constantly get sidetracked by the cascade of follow-up questions that appear one after another, steering me further and further from my original goal. I'd describe it as an unshakeable belief that there must be a better option, which causes intense frustration when you can't find it—or worse, when you know it's just out of reach.

I've learned to work through this feeling and keep it at bay, especially at work, but sometimes it's so strong that it cripples my productivity and creativity. I'm pretty sure many people would relate: instead of actually doing something, I spend more time thinking about and researching how to do it more efficiently or correctly. Some may call it procrastination or even a clinical issue, but after years of fighting it I decided to embrace it by creating a safe space for these obsessive tendencies to run wild. I cautiously believe this approach may actually improve my long-term productivity.

However, going full ~~manic~~ perfectionist from the start proved to be too much. I tried to restart my blog in October 2025, but after two weeks I became overwhelmed trying to address every little detail. There are so many decisions to make in any project, so I will start simple and use familiar technologies and approaches just to get things moving. Last time I struggled with consistency mostly because I tried to do everything perfectly, which ultimately drowned me.

My plan is to start with these decisions:
- Use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) SSG
- Host the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Publish the blog via [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

I'll record the progress of ["Building the plane while flying it"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2zqTYgcpfg) as a Devlog section in my blog.
