# Blog

This blog is a place for me to allow my perfectionism to be free from expectations of productivity, to obsess about every detail, and, of course, to write about the things that interest me.

## Context

I tend to be overly obsessive and pedantic when it comes to finding answers, especially when I'm looking for a 'better' way to do something. I sometimes spend hours falling deeper into the rabbit hole of a perfectionist's spiral when a quick web search for one question leads to dozens of open tabs. I constantly get sidetracked by the cascade of questions that appear one after another, steering me further and further from my initial one. I'd describe it as - "an unshakeable belief that there must be a better option, which causes intense frustration when you can't find it‚Äîor worse, when you know it's just out of reach".
 
I've learned to work through this feeling and to keep it at bay, especially at work, but sometimes it's so strong that it cripples my productivity and creativity. I'm pretty sure a lot of people would relate: instead of actually doing something, I spend more time thinking about and researching how to do it more efficiently. Some may call it procrastination or even a clinical issue, but after years of fighting it I decided to embrace it by creating a safe space for these obsessive tendencies to run wild. I cautiously believe this approach may actually improve my long‚Äëterm productivity.
 
This is the fifth time I'm starting a repository for writing; let's see if this one sticks üòÅ
